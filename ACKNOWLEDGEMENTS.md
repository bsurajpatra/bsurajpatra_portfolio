# Acknowledgements

A big thank you to [CodeWithRandom](https://www.codewithrandom.com/) for their invaluable help in building this personal portfolio website using React.

Their lecture videos and access to sample websites played a significant role in helping me learn and create my own project. I truly appreciate the effort they put into making web development accessible and beginner-friendly!
